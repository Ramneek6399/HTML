<h2 style="color:blue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Main</h2>
<p> <B><span style= color:red>John Connor</span></B>, the son of <i><span style="color:blueviolet ;">Sarah Connor</span></i> and Kyle Reese, is the leader of the worldwide human Resistance,
     as well as the more specialised Tech-Com during the War Against the Machines. Skynet, the supercomputer
     mainframe of the machines, decides that <B><span style= color:red>John Connor</span></B> is the focal point of the rebellion and his termination
     would end the opposition. After repeated failures at terminating <B><span style= color:red>John </span></B> during the war, Skynet decides to use a time
     displacement device to send Terminators to various points in the past in an attempt to terminate him before the war
     even begins.

<h2 style="color:blue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Original timeline</h2>
<p>On the brink of extinction, <B><span style= color:red>John Connor </span></B> united the despairing humans and taught them to fight, storm the camps and overcome
    the Terminator guards. Much of the Resistance was created from these survivors.
    <B><span style= color:red>John Connor</span></B> led the human Resistance to the victory in the War against the Machines in the
    year <u>2029</u>. In order to eliminate <B><span style= color:red>John Connor</span></B>, Skynet sent a <span style= color:green>T-800</span> and a <span style= color:green>T-1000</span> to the past to kill
     <B><span style= color:red> John's</span></B> mother, <i><span style="color:blueviolet ;">Sarah</span></i>, and young <B><span style= color:red>John Connor</span></B> respectively via Time Displacement Equipment. Thus, 
    <span style= color:red>John </span> sends Kyle Reese, a young soldier, and a reprogrammed Series <span style= color:red>800</span> Terminator to the past to protect
    <i><span style="color:blueviolet ;">Sarah Connor</span></i> and young <B><span style= color:red>John Connor</span></B> respectively.</p>
    <h2 style="color:blue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"> Alternative timeline</h2>
<p><B><span style= color:red>John Connor</span></B> was born to <i><span style="color:blueviolet ;">Sarah Connor</span></i> on <u>February 28, 1985</u>. His father, Kyle Reese, had been killed nine months prior in <u>May 1984</u>,
    protecting <i><span style="color:blueviolet ;">Sarah</span></i> from a time-traveling Terminator.<B><span style= color:red> John's</span></B> early life was filled with training by various persons his mother  <i><span style="color:blueviolet ;">Sarah</span></i>
    had met as the two lived off the grid after the attempt on her life by the Terminator. Much of his training concentrated on the areas
    of weaponry, computer technology, and espionage.
    When <i><span style="color:blueviolet ;">Sarah Connor</span></i> was shot and captured after trying to blow up a computer factory in the early <u>1990s</u>, <B><span style= color:red>John </span></B> was placed into foster 
    care and told that his mother's stories of the future were merely delusions. He was unable to cope with life in suburbia and 
    rebelled, edging towards delinquency, turning into a young gangster and receiving a police record (which included trespassing, 
    shoplifting, disturbing the peace, and vandalism) by the time he was <u>10 years old</u>. His foster parents, Todd and Janelle Voight, 
    found themselves unable to deal with him, and were not surprised when a police officer showed up at their door asking to speak with <B><span style= color:red>John </span></B>.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:blue; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Deviating timeline</h2>
    Because Sarah,<B><span style= color:red>John </span></B>, and the <span style= color:green>T-800</span> successfully destroyed the laboratory of Cyberdyne Systems, Skynet is never created and Judgment Day never occurs. 
    In the year <u>2027</u>, <B><span style= color:red>John Connor</span></B> is a U.S. Senator and has a child.
