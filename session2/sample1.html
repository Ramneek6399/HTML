    <img class="margin" src="woody.webp" alt="Woody" style=" height:400px; width:400px; ">
    <p> <B><u><span style="color:red ;">Woody</span></u></B> is the same pull-string cowboy sheriff that <B><u><span style="color:red ;">Andy</span></u></B> fell in love with years ago. 
        Heâ€™s found a new home with Bonnie and her toys, and heâ€™ll do anything to make sure 
        sheâ€™s happy and theyâ€™re all taken care of. But an unexpected reunion with his dear 
        friend <B><u><span style="color:red ;">Bo Peep</span></u></B> shows Woody that the world is much bigger than he ever imagined.</p>
        <h2>Ya know, you've handled this lost toy life better than I could.</h2>
        <h2>You can't teach this old toy new tricks.</h2>
        <h2>Because it's all I have left to do!... I don't have anything else...</h2>
        <h1>&nbsp;BuzzLightYear</h1>
        <img class="margin" src="buzz.webp" alt="buzz" style=" height:400px; width:400px; ">
        <p><B><u><span style="color:red ;">Buzz</span></u></B> Lightyear is loyal not only to his owner, but to the friends heâ€™s made 
            along the wayâ€”especially his once-rival Woody whoâ€™s like a brother to the ace Space Ranger 
            these days. Buzz would do anything to support his pull-string buddy, but when his efforts land him in a 
            carnival game booth as an inadvertent prize, he turns to his inner voice for guidance.
            This is an intergalactic emergency.</p>
        <h2>Do you know these life forms?</h2>
        <h2>My eyeballs could have been sucked from their sockets!</h2>
        <h1>&nbsp;BoPeep</h1>
        <img class="margin" src="bopeep.webp" alt="bopeep" style=" height:400px; width:400px; ">

    <p><B><u><span style="color:red ;">Bo Peep</span></u></B> is a long-lost friend of <B><u><span style="color:red ;">Woody, Buzz</span></u></B> and the gang, who always shared a special connection 
        with Woody while residing with her sheep on a lamp base at <B><u><span style="color:red ;">Andy's</span></u></B> house. After being separated for years,
         Bo has become chipped and discarded, but her spirit is far from broken. She has grown into an adventure-seeking 
         free spirit whose strength and sarcasm belie her delicate porcelain exterior.
         Open your eyes, Woody. There's plenty of kids out there. Sometimes change can be good!</p>
