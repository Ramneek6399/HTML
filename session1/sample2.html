                 of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born 
                 mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University
                 of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in Economics and Physics. He moved to
                 California in <u>1995</u> to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business

            <p>
                Elon Reeve <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> was born on <u>June 28, 1971</u>, in Pretoria, one of the capital cities of apartheid
                South Africa.[8][9] His mother is Maye <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> (nÃ©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in
                Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in South Africa.[10][11][12] His father is Errol <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B>, a 
                South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer
                who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[13][14] <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> has a
                younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[12][15] His
                maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took
                his family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa and
                Australia.[16][17][18] <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[19][20] He was
                baptized into the Anglican Church. 
                </p>
                <p>
                <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B>'s family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the Pretoria City 
                Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with the <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> children 
                reportedly sharing their father's dislike of apartheid.[8] After his parents divorced in <u>1980</u>,
                <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> mostly lived with his father,[19] a choice he made two years after the divorce and
                subsequently regretted.[23] <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> has become estranged from his father.[23] He has a paternal
                half-sister and a half-brother.

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[31] <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> applied for a Canadian
                passport through his Canadian-born mother.[32][33] While awaiting the documentation, he attended 
                the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the
                South African military.[34] <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin
                in Saskatchewan for a year,[35] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[36] In <u>1990</u>, he entered
                Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[37][38] Two years later, he transferred to the University 
                of Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a 
                Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School in <u>1995</u>.
                </p><p> In 1994, <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> held two 
                internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research 
                Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo 
                Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.[41] In <u>1995</u>, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy
                (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.[42] <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> tried to get 
                a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.[32] He dropped out of Stanford
                after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch a startup.

                <h3>
                    Zip2
                </h3>

                <p> 
                In <u>1995</u>, <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B>, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds borrowed
                from <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B>'s father.[44][23] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[45] The company
                developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions,
                and yellow pages.[46] <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and
                instead rented an office; he slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother. 
                </p>
        
                <p>
                According to <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B>, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all
                the time."[45] The <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[48]
                and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[49] <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B>'s attempts 
                to become ceo were thwarted by the board.[50] Compaq acquired Zip2 for <span style=color:green> $</span>307 million in cash in February 
                <u>1999</u>,[51][52] and <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> received <span style=color:green> $</span>22 million for his 7-percent share.
                </p>
                <h3>X.com and PayPal</h3>
                <p>
                In <u>1999</u>, <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[54] The startup
                was one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over
                200,000 customers joined the service.[55] The company's investors regarded <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> as inexperienced and
                replaced him with Intuit ceo Bill Harris by the end of the year.[56] The following year, X.com merged 
                with online bank Confinity to avoid competition.[45][56][57] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel,[58] 
                Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service. 
                </p>
                <p>Within the merged company, <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> returned as ceo. <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B>'s preference for Microsoft software over Unix created
                a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[60] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a 
                cohesive business model, the board ousted <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> and replaced him with Thiel in September <u>2000</u>.[61][b] Under
                Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[63][64] In <u>2002</u>, PayPal 
                was acquired by eBay for <span style=color:green> $</span>1.5 billion in stock, of which <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B>â€”the largest shareholder with 11.72% of 
                sharesâ€”received <span style=color:green> $</span>175.8 million.[65][66] In <u>2017</u>, <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an 
                undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental value.</p>
                <h3> SpaceX</h3>
                <p>
                    
                In early <u>2001</u>, <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a 
                growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[69] In October the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell 
                and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse
                payloads into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> was seen as a novice[70]
                and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February <u>2002</u>, the group returned to Russia with 
                Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were
                offered one rocket for <span style=color:green> $</span>8 million, which <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build 
                affordable rockets.[70] With <span style=color:green> $</span>100 million of his early fortune,[71] <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> founded <span style=color:red> SpaceX</span> in <u>May 2002</u> and became
                the company's <b>ceo</b> and Chief Engineer. 
                </p><p><span style=color:red> SpaceX</span> attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[74] 
                Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services
                program contract from NASA Administrator (and former <span style=color:red> SpaceX</span> consultant[75]) Mike Griffin later that year.[76][77]
                After two more failed attempts that nearly caused <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> and his companies to bankrupt,[74] <span style=color:red> SpaceX</span> succeeded in
                launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[78] Later that year, <span style=color:red> SpaceX</span> received a <span style=color:green> $</span>1.6 billion Commercial
                Resupply Services program contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft 
                to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after its <u>2011</u> retirement.[79] In <u>2012</u>, 
                the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.[80] <B><span style= color:blue>Musk</span></B> credited the NASA award,
                one of the last actions by Mike Griffin as NASA Administrator, for saving the company.
